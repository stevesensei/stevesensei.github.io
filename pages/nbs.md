				<h2>About NBS</h2>
				<p>
					(太专业了不翻译了)The .nbs format (Note Block Song) was created to work with Minecraft Note Block Studio, and contains data about how note blocks are laid out in the program to form a song. <br><br> To bring new features to Note Block Studio and make it future-proof, we are using an improved file format. The first 2 bytes of the .nbs file have been changed to 0 to indicate the new format.<br><br>
					All the data types found in a .nbs file are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signedness" target="_blank">signed</a>, and in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness" target="_blank">little-endian</a>. Strings consist of a 32-bit integer, and then that many bytes for the characters. The file is made up of four parts, two of which are mandatory:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Header</li>
					<li>Note blocks</li>
					<li>Layers (Optional)</li>
					<li>Custom instruments (Optional)</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					<span>If the information provided below differs from the old .nbs format, they are marked </span> <strong><span style="color: #01cc01c7">Green</span></strong>.

				<h2>NBS Changelog</h2>
				<div>
					<strong>Version 4.0:</strong> 
					<ul><li>Loop on/off, max loop count, and loop start tick are now saved.</li><li>The program now saves which layers are locked.</li><li>Note blocks now store velocity, panning, and pitch. These work in conjunction with layer volume and layer stereo.</li></ul>
					<strong>Version 3.0:</strong> 
					<ul><li>Song length is now saved again after the vanilla instrument count.</li></ul>
					<strong>Version 2.0:</strong> 
					<ul><li>Now stereo information is saved for each layer. This means that now the sound can pan to the left/right.</li><li>For every layer, there's now a byte that determines how much that layer pans.<br>0 is 2 blocks right, 100 is centre, 200 is 2 blocks left.</li></ul>
					<strong>Version 1.0 (initial version):</strong> 
					<ul><li>The first two bytes, which used to indicate the song length, have been changed to 0 to indicate the new format.</li>
					<li>The NBS version is now stored in the file.</li>
					<li>The byte after the NBS version is now the amount of vanilla instruments.<br>
					This change was necessary because, previously, the program didn't know when the custom instruments began. It always went up to 9, and everything after that was treated as a custom instrument.</li></ul>

		<h2>Part 2: Note blocks</h2>
		<p>The next part contains the information about how the note blocks are placed, what instruments they have and what note. As you may know, the song is divided into ticks (horizontally) and layers (vertically). Often, a majority of the ticks and layers in the song are empty, which is why we specify the amount of "jumps" to the next active tick or layer, rather than just a bunch of empty slots.<br><br>
		The pattern of the note block format is as follows:</p>
		<div class="table-wrapper">
			<table class="alt">
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Type</th>
						<th>Name</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Short</td>
						<td>Jumps to the next tick</td>
						<td>The amount of "jumps" to the next tick with at least one note block in it. We start at tick -1. If the amount of jumps is 0, the program will stop reading and proceed to the next part.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Short</td>
						<td>Jumps to the next layer</td>
						<td>Once we have found an active tick, we read the amount of vertical jumps to the next layer. We start at layer -1. If this is 0, we go back to step 1. If not, we have found a note block!</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Byte</td>
						<td>Note block instrument</td>
						<td>The instrument of the note block. This is 0-15, or higher if the song uses custom instruments.<br>
							<strong>0 = </strong>Piano (Air)<br>
							<strong>1 = </strong>Double Bass (Wood)<br>
							<strong>2 = </strong>Bass Drum (Stone)<br>
							<strong>3 = </strong>Snare Drum (Sand)<br>
							<strong>4 = </strong>Click (Glass)<br>
							<strong>5 = </strong>Guitar (Wool)<br>
							<strong>6 = </strong>Flute (Clay)<br>
							<strong>7 = </strong>Bell (Block of Gold)<br>
							<strong>8 = </strong>Chime (Packed Ice)<br>
							<strong>9 = </strong>Xylophone (Bone Block)<br>
							<span class="newversion">
								<strong>10 = </strong>Iron Xylophone (Iron Block)<br>
								<strong>11 = </strong>Cow Bell (Soul Sand)<br>
								<strong>12 = </strong>Didgeridoo (Pumpkin)<br>
								<strong>13 = </strong>Bit (Block of Emerald)<br>
								<strong>14 = </strong>Banjo (Hay)<br>
								<strong>15 = </strong>Pling (Glowstone)
							</span>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Byte</td>
						<td>Note block key</td>
						<td>The key of the note block, from 0-87, where 0 is A0 and 87 is C8. 33-57 is within the 2-octave limit.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="newversion"> 
						<td>Byte</td>
						<td>Note block velocity</td>
						<td>The velocity/volume of the note block, from 0% to 100%.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="newversion">
						<td>Byte</td>
						<td>Note block panning</td>
						<td>The stereo position of the note block, from 0-200. 100 is center panning.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="newversion">
						<td>Short (Signed)</td>
						<td>Note block pitch</td>
						<td>The fine pitch of the note block, from -32,768 to 32,767 cents (but the max in Note Block Studio is limited to -1200 and +1200). 0 is no fine-tuning. ±100 cents is a single semitone difference. After reading this, we go back to step 2.</td>

		<h2>Part 3: Layers</h2>
		<p>
			This part is optional. You can choose to stop writing here and the Note Block Studio will still load the song.
			However, you cannot simply jump to the next part.<br>
			<br>
			Here the information about the layers are stored, which includes their name, volume and stereo. These values are repeated the same number of layers in the song (the song height, specified in the header):

		<h2>Part 4: Custom instruments</h2>
		<p>Finally, the custom instruments of the song are stored. Like the previous part, this is optional. You can stop writing here and the song will still be loaded.<br><br>
			A song can have a maximum of <span class="newversion">18</span> custom instruments, each with a name and sound file assigned to it. The sound file must be located in the /Sounds folder of the Minecraft Note Block Studio directory.
		Before we begin, we need to know the amount of custom instruments:</p>
		<div class="table-wrapper">
			<table class="alt">
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th style="text-align: left">Type</th>
						<th style="text-align: left">Name</th>

					<tr>
						<td style="text-align: left">Byte</td>
						<td style="text-align: left">Custom instruments</td>
						<td style="text-align: left">The amount of custom instruments (0-<span class="newversion">18</span>).</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>

		</div><br> 
		<p>The next four values are repeated the number of custom instruments:</p>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td style="text-align: left">Byte</td>
						<td style="text-align: left">Sound pitch</td>
						<td style="text-align: left">The pitch of the sound file. Just like the note blocks, this ranges from 0-87. Default is 45 (F#4).</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td style="text-align: left">Byte</td>
						<td style="text-align: left">Press key</td>
						<td style="text-align: left">Whether the piano should automatically press keys with this instrument when the marker passes them (0 or 1).</td>
